Because of the stories and wealth he brought back from his adventures, Bilbo Baggins is the most famous hobbit in Hobbiton.
 He is also considered a bit strange, however.
 The fact that he receives visits at his house, Bag End, from Elves, Dwarves, and the wizard Gandalf make him the object of some slight suspicion.
 In addition, ever since Bilbo came back to the Shire with the ring—which he has kept secret from nearly everyone—he has not seemed to age at all.
 In fact, he reaches his 111th birthday virtually unchanged.

When Bilbo announces that he is throwing a grand party for his “eleventy-first” birthday, everyone in the Shire takes interest.
 After extensive and elaborate preparation, the day of Bilbo’s birthday finally arrives.
 All of Hobbiton has a fine time eating, drinking, and watching the spectacular fireworks provided by Gandalf.
